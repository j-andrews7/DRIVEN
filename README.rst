VAMPIRE
========

VAMPIRE (Variant and Epigenetic anNotation for Underlying Significance and Regulation) is a suite of tools geared towards easy integration of multiple types of big data to make reasonable and interesting biological conclusions. Designed to be *modular* so that each tool is useful in its own right, but also capable of being a pipeline in and of itself, VAMPIRE aims to help scientists and clinicians better understand the differences between their data sets. Specifically, VAMPIRE was built to help identify functionally significant epigenetic lesions in cancer caused by genetic mutations in non-coding regulatory elements.
