# VENUSAUR

VENUSAUR (Variant and Epigenetic anNotation for Underlying Significance And Regulation) is a full-fledged bioinformatics suite geared towards easy integration of multiple types of big data to make reasonable and interesting biological conclusions. Designed to be *modular* so that each tool is useful in its own right, but also capable of being a pipeline in and of itself, VENUSAUR aims to help scientists and clinicians better understand the differences between their data sets.

There are a number of potential uses for VENUSAUR, such as:
 - Scanning VCF files for variants that perturb or create new TF motifs.
 - Identifying differential ChIP-seq peaks between samples.
    - Corroborating these differences with gene expression.
    - Creation of predicted gene regulatory networks.
 - Decomposition of SNV motif frequency with respect to their surrounding sequence to identify mutational signatures that might be attributed to specific generating processes.

These tasks can be done on an individual basis or all at once.
